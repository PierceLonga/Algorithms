# Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that stores items in a Last-In/First-Out (LIFO) or First-In/Last-Out (FILO) manner. In stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.

```# Python program to
# demonstrate stack implementation
# using list
 
stack = []
 
# append() function to push
# element in the stack
stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')
 
print('Initial stack')
print(stack)
 
# pop() function to pop
# element from stack in
# LIFO order
print('\nElements popped from stack:')
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
print(stack.pop())
 
print('\nStack after elements are popped:')
print(stack)
 
# uncommenting print(stack.pop())
# will cause an IndexError
# as the stack is now empty```
